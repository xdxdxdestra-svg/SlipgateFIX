# Third-Party Notices

Slipgate is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
v3.0 (see [LICENSE](./LICENSE)). It bundles, modifies and links against a
number of upstream open-source projects whose authors and licenses are
acknowledged below.

If you redistribute Slipgate (in source or binary form) you must preserve
this file together with [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and [COPYRIGHT](./COPYRIGHT).

## 1. Koala Clash

UI architecture, page-transition animations, several React components, the
Tailwind theme tokens and various visual primitives in Slipgate's renderer
are derived from **Koala Clash**.

- Upstream: <https://github.com/coolcoala/koala-clash>
- License: GNU General Public License v3.0 (or later)
- Copyright (C) Koala Clash contributors

Modified files in `src/renderer/` carry a header noting the modification
date and a short description of what was changed. The full text of the
GPL applies to those files exactly as it does to the rest of Slipgate.

> Slipgate's choice of GPL-3.0 as its overall license is a direct
> consequence of using Koala Clash sources: GPL is copyleft and requires
> any derivative work to be licensed under the same terms.

## 2. Flowseal/tg-ws-proxy (TgWsProxy)

The bundled `TgWsProxy_windows.exe` is a CLI rebuild of
**Flowseal/tg-ws-proxy** — a Telegram MTProto-over-WebSocket relay.

- Upstream source: <https://github.com/Flowseal/tg-ws-proxy>
- Slipgate's CLI rebuild mirror:
  <https://github.com/xdxdxdestra-svg/slipgate-tgws-cli>
- License: GNU General Public License v3.0
- Copyright (C) Flowseal and tg-ws-proxy contributors

The mirror exists because the official Flowseal release ships a tray-GUI
binary (entry point `windows.py` + `pystray`) that pops a first-run
dialog, parks a tray icon, ignores `--host`/`--port`/`--secret` CLI args
and acquires a single-instance mutex incompatible with Slipgate's
headless integration. The mirror rebuilds the exact same source through
PyInstaller against `proxy.tg_ws_proxy:main` (the CLI entry point),
producing a true headless `.exe` with no UI surface. No source code is
modified — only the build configuration.

## 3. bol-van/zapret + Flowseal/zapret-discord-youtube (Zapret bundle)

The bundled DPI-bypass strategies and `winws.exe` come from
**Flowseal/zapret-discord-youtube**, which itself bundles
**bol-van/zapret**.

- Flowseal bundle: <https://github.com/Flowseal/zapret-discord-youtube>
  - License: GNU General Public License v3.0
- Underlying engine `bol-van/zapret`: <https://github.com/bol-van/zapret>
  - License: Mostly under MIT-style license, with portions under custom
    permissive terms; see the upstream `LICENSE.txt` shipped inside
    `resources/zapret/`.
- Copyright (C) bol-van and zapret contributors
- Copyright (C) Flowseal and zapret-discord-youtube contributors

Slipgate redistributes the bundle verbatim, plus a small set of
Slipgate-specific patches applied at build time by
`scripts/build-zapret/build.bat`. The patches are documented in that
script and add `--profile` plumbing needed by Slipgate's strategy
selector; they are released under the same terms as the upstream files
they touch.

## 4. WinDivert

Bundled inside `resources/zapret/bin/` as `WinDivert.dll` and
`WinDivert64.sys`, used by `winws.exe` for low-level packet
interception on Windows.

- Upstream: <https://reqrypt.org/windivert.html>
- License: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)
  with a special linking exception, OR a commercial license at the
  user's option.
- Copyright (C) 2012-2024 basil00

Slipgate distributes WinDivert as an unmodified binary alongside
`winws.exe` per the LGPL terms. WinDivert can be replaced by the
end user with any binary-compatible build of the library.

## 5. Sparkle (Russian community fork) — historical heritage

Slipgate started life as a fork of a Russian community fork of
**Sparkle**, and has since been rewritten end-to-end. None of the
original Sparkle source survives in current Slipgate code, but the
project layout and a handful of build-side conventions trace back to
that lineage.

## 6. NPM dependencies

The `package.json` lists every direct npm dependency. They are pulled
in at install time via `pnpm install`, are not redistributed in source
form by Slipgate, and are governed by their own licenses (predominantly
MIT, ISC and Apache-2.0). Notable bundled libraries:

## How attribution works in practice

- Every source file copied or substantially adapted from one of the
  upstreams above carries a header noting the original copyright and
  the date of modification, per the requirements of GPL-3.0 §5(a).
- This file (`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`) and `LICENSE`, `COPYRIGHT` are
  shipped alongside every Slipgate release (source archive AND
  installer) so end users can always trace provenance.
- If you find an upstream that should be acknowledged here and isn't,
  please open an issue on the Slipgate GitHub repo — we'll add it.
